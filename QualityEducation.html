<p><strong>ABOUT US:<br />
</strong>What we are doing: <br />
Before you can expect learners to succeed academically, students should also 
feel safe both mentally and physically. While most of the schools take physical 
safety measures, not many learning platforms consider the mental safety of the 
learners. So, we are making a website filled with motivational quotes, 
meditation videos, inspirational stories about successful people, and more. 
Students can access this when they feel demotivated or don’t feel like studying.

<p>Inspirational stories: Kentucky fried chicken: The real-life story of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonel_Sanders">Colonel Harland Sanders
</a>who was disappointed umpteen times in his life and still made his dream come 
true late in his life is really inspiring.&nbsp; He is a seventh grade drop out who 
tried many ventures in life but tasted bitter every time. He started selling 
chicken at the age of 40 but his dream of a restaurant was turned down many 
times due to conflicts and wars. Later he attempted to franchise his restaurant. 
His recipe got rejected 1,009 times before the final approval. And soon the 
secret recipe, “Kentucky Fried Chicken” became a huge hit worldwide. KFC was 
expanded globally and the company was sold for 2 million dollars and his face is 
still celebrated in the logos.<br />

<p>&nbsp;Moral: Have you stopped your attempts at a venture just because you 
were rejected or failed a few times? Can you even accept a failure 1009 times? 
This story inspires everyone to try hard and believe in yourself until you see 
success despite how many times you have failed. &nbsp; &nbsp; Shark bait: A marine 
biologist put a shark into a big tank at the time of a research experiment. 
Followed by that, he released some tiny bait fishes into it.
