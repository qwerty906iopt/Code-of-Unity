Environment that is both healthy and safe<p><strong>&nbsp;Problems associated with not having access to internet and not having 
access to education:&nbsp; <br />
</strong>Today, education remains an inaccessible right for millions of children around 
the world. More than 72 million children of primary education age are not in 
school and 759 million adults are illiterate and do not have the awareness 
necessary to improve both their living conditions So many children and young 
people have no internet at home is more than a digital gap. Lack of connectivity 
doesn’t just limit children and young people’s ability to connect online. It 
isolates them from the world. And in the event of school closures, such as those 
currently experienced by millions due to COVID-19, it causes them to lose out on 
education. Nearly a quarter of a billion students worldwide are still affected 
by COVID-19 school closures, forcing hundreds of millions of students to rely on 
virtual learning. For those with no internet access, education can be out of 
reach.
